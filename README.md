# üöÄ Modern Windows 11 Setup Script

This is my personal Windows 11 setup script, built with ‚ù§Ô∏è, ‚òï and Chocolatey.  
It configures my dev environment, installs essential tools, applies system tweaks, and removes Microsoft bloat ‚Äî all in one go.

> Because "manual install" is a curse word in my house.
